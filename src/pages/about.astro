	<h1 class="title">About</h1>
	<p class="mb-4">
    Hi, I'm Yiyuan Li, a Computer Science student based in Singapore. I like low-level programming, computer graphics, and all things that boost developer productivity. Vim + Tmux, I'm always exploring ways to optimize how we work with code.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I especially enjoy working with Rust and Go, and I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projectsâ€”particularly if they involve systems programming or graphics. If that sounds like your kind of thing, feel free to drop me a line at yy@yuan.me.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    When I'm not deep in the terminal, I like spending time with my girlfriend, Deep House / Techno is the way to go, or binge-watching movies (so sad dont have much of times now). Im just trying to make sense of the digital world.
  </p>
