*It's a symbol of a fresh start. Let's see what it turns out to be.*

## Well, this is the first post

About a week ago, I re-entered Singapore from China, to a place that changed the course of my life forever. This return is more like a farewell to the person I've been for the past 3 years. *(as for why I'm saying this, why I'm went back to China, hopefully I'll be able to post about it here one day int the future, but never now.)*

So, the first thing I want to do is set up a blog (which I’ve been working on for the past couple of days). I plan to update it with some ongoing projects and some life-related content. Of course, more importantly, I need a portfolio to help me land a stable job. But I don’t want this to turn into a purely technical nerd blog or a place where artsy young people show off their lives, because I’m neither of those.

This isn’t my first time setting up a blog. I created my first personal blog four years ago, but for some reason, I didn’t keep it going.

Let’s see what happens next.

## What can you expect next?

In the next few blog posts, I'll be sharing some content about DSA, the projects I’m currently working on or researching, and of course, some of my Linux workflow configurations.
